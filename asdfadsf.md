LLC services:
- Connection mode service
- Acknowledged connectionless service
- Unacknowledged connectionless service



Every station connected to an Ethernet network is provided with a 6-byte physical address, known as a MAC address, which is typically stored in the network interface card (NIC).



When 2 or more bits in a data unit has been changed during the transmission, the error is called - Burst Error



The Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer of the Data Link Layer performs data link functions that depend upon the type of medium, such as controlling access to the network medium and addressing frames for transmission


**BGP protocol**

- UPDATE and NOTIFICATION messages are used for - Exchanging reachability information and to notify an error
- BGP relies on IGP for packet forwarding between IBGP peers
- BGP communication packet types are OPEN, UPDATE, NOTIFICATION, KEEPALIVE




Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is Link state routing protocol.


Distance-vector routing protocol uses the Bellman-Ford algorithm to calculate the best path for forwarding IP packets.



**FTP**

- uses port 21
- control connection is used by FTP to send messages to the client in response to control commands

## TCP

 - All TCP connections are full-duplex and point-to-point.  
 - TCP does not support multicasting or broadcasting.
 - Header size = 20 to 60 bytes



responsible for restricting TCP segment = 
IP payload and Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of the link


Sender window in TCP
Sender Window = min(Congestion Window, Receiver Window)


## UDP

- UDP doesn't have any flow control, congestion control
-  DNS used UDP

outstanding frames = Frames that have been transmitted, but not yet acknowledged



Initializes the file descriptor set fd_set — a bitmap of fixed size  
FD_ZERO: Initializes the file descriptor set fd_set – a bitmap of fixed size


The rate of increase in the congestion window is very slow

video conferencing = Real-Time variable bit rate

traffic scheduling algorithm = Weighted Fair Queuing (WFQ)

Intra-domain routing is used within a single network, while inter-domain routing is used between different networks.



Notes:
- RIP is a distance vector routing protocol used for small to medium-sized networks.
- BGP is used for inter-domain routing on the Internet
- Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) is  a link state routing protocol, used for intra-domain routing in the Internet




## QoS
- The primary goal of QoS is

Which of the following datastructures are used for speeding up the Longest Prefix Matching based Forwarding algorithms in routers?
- Ans: Patricia Trees



MAC protocols enable two nodes using their separate communication resources to establish, maintain and terminate a connection.
